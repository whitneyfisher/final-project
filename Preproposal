# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

I have a few ideas for my final project which, all of which are games. One idea is to create a platfomer game using Pygame. Another idea I 
had was a break out game, which would include a paddle that controls the ball, and the ball breaks the bricks at the top. If I choose this 
one, I was thinking of adding in different elements into the game to add onto it. Another idea I had was to create a game of hangman,
but one in which the computer has a strategy that always cheats the game.



## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

N/A

## Do you have any questions of your own?

I am having a hard time figuring out if my ideas are too easy, or they may cause me some diffuclty as I continue on with my project.
