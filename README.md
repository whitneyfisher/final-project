# Breakout


This final project was creating a Breakout game using python. To complete this project I used Pygame. My initial goals for this project was to create a breakout game that consisted of many unique features, like power-ups, obstacles, and different levels, but some of these were not able to be completed. 

There was a learning curve involved when trying to use Pygame for the first time because it had many features that I had to learn, like different methods, classes, and functions. I also had to learn how to create a game loop that held many different events and classes, such as the ball class or the wall class. One of the more difficult parts of this project, aside from learning how to use Pygame, was how to do the animations, especially creating the bricks. 

However, after completing my project I feel that I have learned so much more about python that I have not known before, even to the simpliest things like creating the game window, or creating a bunch of different classes and seeing them being implementing into the game. Because of this project I got to learn how to create classes of different objects, how to implement sound in code, how to do things like move the paddle based on key input, etc. 

My favorite part of the project was seeing it all come together. I loved finally figuring out how to do things like have the ball collide against the bricks, running the code and seeing the class and new feature be added to the game. Another one of my favorite parts was adding the sound elements, which I had some diffuclty with when I was trying to add a game over sound. 

Ideally, however, I would have finished my orignal idea of creating my unique features like the different levels and obstacles. I also really wanted to get a seperate start up screen, but was having diffuculy figuring out how to get rid of the bricks. Looking back at my proposal file, however, I was able to complete the features of the game that I knew I would be able to complete, and some extra like adding sound.
